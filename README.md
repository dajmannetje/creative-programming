# creative-programming
Hello! 
This is the Lego brick code made on processing 3.4.5 made by Amjad Azimane for the TU/E creative programming.

IMPORTANT BEFORE YOU START: 
This program makes use of the video library. Install the library by going to tools -> add tool -> Libraries -> 
filter on video -> and install the one made by The processing foundation.
 
This program turns your camera into a nice lego portrait, surrounded with a lego frame in the average colour 
of all lego blocks displayed.
You can customize the lego blocks of size by moving your mouse around the sketch, making them bigger. 
You can also change the form of the lego bricks, by changing the offset of the circles of the brick, 
or making the bricks rectangular instead of square.
You can take a pic by clicking on the sketch, a message should appear in the debugger with the name of your sketch.
In your sketchfolder(ctrl+k while being on the code itself) will the sketch be stored.

If there are no errors displayed by processing, but you still dont get any image on your sketch, you should check if 
your camera is working, and more importantly, *that there are no other applications using your camera*, or else it 
indeed would not pick up your camera.

If you encouter any problems with the code, you can email me to dajmannetje@gmail.com and explain what went wrong.

I wish you a fun time exploring what kind of pictures you can take.
